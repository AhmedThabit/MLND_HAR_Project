# MLND_Capstone: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Deep Learning 
Capstone project for Machine learning Nanodegree at Udacity

## Introduction

In this project, I have built two models - RF model and a deep learning model - RNN (LSTM) model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

## Required Libary
 - numpy
 - tensorflow
 - keras
 - pandas
 - seaborn
 - sklearn
 - matplotlib
 - prettytable


## Running
The entire code is under following ipython notebooks
EDA.ipynb
PREDICTION_RF.ipynb
PREDICTION_LSTM.ipynb

## Data
Dataset available here - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones/

## Final result
Using RF model, I am getting accuracy ~ 91%.
Using Deep Leraning model - RNN (LSTM), I am getting accuracy at
 - LSTM 1 ~ 83%.
 - LSTM 2 ~ 81%.
 - LSTM 3 ~ 89%.
might be because we don't study this type of arch.
